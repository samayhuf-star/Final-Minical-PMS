# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Minical team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email support@minical.io (also CC pankaj@minical.io) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The Minical team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. 
After the initial reply to your report you will be kept informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement.

Report security bugs in third-party dependencies to the person or team maintaining the module.
